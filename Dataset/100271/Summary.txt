Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2001 Chrysler Sebring, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the eastbound left-turn lane of a three-lane, two-way private road that connects a company parking lot with a state roadway (one eastbound right-turn lane, one eastbound left-turn lane, and one westbound lane) and was approaching a T-intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling south in the southbound through-lane of a three-lane, two-way road (one southbound right-turn lane, one southbound through-lane, and one northbound lane) and was approaching the same intersection as V1. It was daylight, the sky was clear, and the bituminous roads were dry. The driver of V1 attempted to turn left at the intersection and the front of V2 struck the left-side of V1 in a T-type configuration. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 44-year-old male driver of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel airbag deployed. He was transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center.
