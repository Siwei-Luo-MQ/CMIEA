Based on the provided sketch and summary, let's execute the analysis using the specified methodology for a merge road type.

### Analysis Steps:

1. **Road Type**: **Merge**
   - We will use the top-left point of the main road as (0,0).

2. **Mapping**:
   - Identify the top-left corner of the main road in the sketch (this will be established as (0, 0)).
   - Establish the X-axis horizontally (right as positive) and the Y-axis vertically (upward as positive).

3. **Extract Starting and Collision Points**:
   - **Vehicle V1 (Pontiac Sunfire)**:
     - Traveling east in the right lane.
     - Starting Point: Estimated just before the merging point, \((15, 3)\).
     - Collision Point: Estimated at the merging area, close to the left lane of V1, approximately \((30, 3)\).
   - **Vehicle V2 (Dodge Ram conversion van)**:
     - Coming from the ramp, trying to enter the main road.
     - Starting Point: Estimated on the ramp before merging, \((20, 3)\).
     - Collision Point: Same as V1, approximately \((30, 3)\).

4. **Predict Trajectories**:
   - **V1 trajectory**: Going from \((15, 3)\) to \((30, 3)\):
     - Prediction: \([(15, 3), (20, 3), (25, 3), (28, 3), (30, 3)]\)
   - **V2 trajectory**: Going from \((20, 3)\) to \((30, 3)\):
     - Prediction: \([(20, 3), (22, 3.5), (25, 3), (28, 2.5), (30, 3)]\)

5. **Validation**: Assessing the predicted trajectories against the crash summary:
   - V1 lost control due to standing water, leading to a counterclockwise spin into the merging lane.
   - V2 attempted to brake but struck V1 on the left side as they collided in the merge area.

### Output Summary:
```json
{
    'V1_traj': [(15, 3), (20, 3), (25, 3), (28, 3), (30, 3)],
    'V2_traj': [(20, 3), (22, 3.5), (25, 3), (28, 2.5), (30, 3)],
    'Validation': 'Pass'
}
```

This output captures the predicted trajectories while aligning with the behaviors described in the crash summary.
