Based on the provided sketch and crash summary, here are the extracted configuration details of the road network:

1. **Number of ways**: 2 (as indicated by "two-lane, two-way")
2. **Number of lanes**: 2 (as indicated by "two-lane")
3. **Length of the road**: 50 meters (approximated from the sketch as 10 car lengths)
4. **Width of a single lane**: 4 meters (calculated as the width of the car plus half on each side)
5. **Curvature**: small (based on the description of the curve in comparison to the provided curvature examples)

Formatted output:
{'No_ways': 2, 'No_lanes': 2, 'Length': 50, 'Width': 4, 'Curvature': 'small'}
