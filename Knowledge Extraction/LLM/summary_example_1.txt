Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle). a 2000 Chevrolet Malibu, 4-door sedan was traveling north in the right northbound lane of a limited access, four-lane, divided freeway (two lanes northbound, open median, two lanes southbound). Vehicle two (V2), a 1998 International tractor-trailer was traveling north in the left northbound lane of the same roadway but was slightly behind V1. For an unknown reason, the driver of V1 suddenly veered to the left and into the left northbound lane. The driver of V2 could not avoid V1 and the front of V2 struck the left-side of V1. The 63-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was not using the available 3-point seat belt and no airbags deployed. This vehicle is equipped with frontal-impact airbags that did not deploy, but is not equipped with side-impact airbags. The driver of V1 was transported to a regional level-one trauma center via helicopter. Both vehicles were reportedly towed due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 expired 3 months post-crash due to a pre-exisiting illness not attributed to the crash.
