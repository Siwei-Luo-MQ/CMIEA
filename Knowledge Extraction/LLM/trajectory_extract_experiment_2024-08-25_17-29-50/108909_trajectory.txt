Let's analyze the provided case according to the specified instructions for a "Merge" road type and construct the output.

### Step 1: Road Type and Mapping
- **Road Type**: **Merge**
- **Mapping**:
  - Use the top-left point of the main road as the origin (0, 0).
  - Establish the X-axis horizontally (right as the positive direction) and the Y-axis vertically (upwards as the positive direction).

### Step 2: Extract Starting and Collision Points
Based on the sketch and summary:
- **V1 (Jeep Cherokee)** is entering the right westbound lane and begins to rotate into the lane.
- **V2 (Peterbilt truck)** is traveling in the right lane and collides with V1.

### Assumed Start and Collision Points
- **V1**: 
  - Starting Point: Positioned slightly left of the merge area towards the top.
  - Estimated Coordinates: (10, -5) (since V1 is on the entrance ramp)
  - Collision Point: (15, -5) (where it enters V2's lane).

- **V2**: 
  - Starting Point: (15, -3) (as it's in the right lane).
  - Collision Point: Also (15, -5) (where the collision occurs).

### Step 3: Predict Trajectories
- **V1 trajectory**: Start at (10, -5), moving into the collision point with intermediate points (12, -4), (13, -4.5), (14, -4.8), ending at (15, -5).
- **V2 trajectory**: Start at (15, -3), maintain its path with intermediate points (15, -4), (15, -4.5), (15, -5), ending at (15, -5).

### Step 4: Validation
- Both vehicles’ predicted trajectories and behaviors described in the summary align, with V1 losing control and moving into V2’s lane.

### Final Output
```json
{
    'V1_traj': [(10, -5), (12, -4), (13, -4.5), (14, -4.8), (15, -5)],
    'V2_traj': [(15, -3), (15, -4), (15, -4.5), (15, -5), (15, -5)],
    'Validation': 'Pass'
}
``` 

This output reflects the predicted trajectories based on the crash sketch and summary, providing a comprehensive overview of the incident.
