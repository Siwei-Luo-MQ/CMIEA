Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2004 Chevrolet Aveo, 5-door hatchback was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way, rural roadway. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Chevrolet Malibu, 4-door sedan was also traveling west in the westbound lane and was ahead of V1. Vehicle three (V3), a 1999 GMC Sierra K1500, 2-door pickup truck pulling a utility trailer was traveling east in the eastbound lane of the same roadway. It was daylight, raining, and the bituminous road was wet. The driver of V1 reported that he suddenly recognized that V2 was in front of him and he attempted to avoid V2 by steering to the left, but the right side of V1 struck the rear corner of V2. The driver of V3 saw V1 enter the eastbound lane and attempted to avoid a collision by steering to the right. V3 was partially off the road but the front of V1 struck the left side of V3's utility trailer. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. V2 and V3 were both driven from the scene, but V3's utility trailer was reportedly obliterated. The 63-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel airbag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center.
