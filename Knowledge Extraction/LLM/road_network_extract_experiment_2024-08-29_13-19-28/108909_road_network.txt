To analyze the given crash scenario, let's break it down according to the specified questions:

1. **Extract the number of ways and lanes from the crash summary:**
   - From the summary, V1 is traveling on an entrance ramp and attempting to enter a six-lane freeway. It states: "six-lane, divided, limited-access freeway (three lanes westbound, protected median, three lanes eastbound)".
   - This indicates that there are **2 ways** on the main road (westbound and eastbound).
   - The main road has **6 lanes** (3 for westbound and 3 for eastbound).
   - V2 is traveling on the right lane of the westbound freeway, indicating the branch road (entrance ramp) has **2 lanes** (as inferred from the two vehicles marked on it). 

2. **Approximate the length of the main road and the width of the lane from the sketch:**
   - The length of the main road can be estimated from the sketch size. It appears to be approximately **10 car lengths** long (considering each car is 5 meters).
   - Therefore, \( \text{Length}_{\text{main}} = 5 \times 10 = 50 \) meters.
   - For lane width, V1 is centrally located in its lane and given the vehicles in the sketch, we estimate the width of the lane to be **4 meters**.

3. **Approximate the merge_angle:**
   - The sketch depicts V1 on the merge area at an angle to the main road. Estimating visually, the angle appears to be close to 45 degrees based on its curvature, indicating a **big** merge angle.

Now, consolidating all the extracted information, the output would be:

```json
{
  'No_ways_main_road': 2,
  'No_lanes_main_road': 6,
  'No_lanes_branch_road': 2,
  'Length_main': 50,
  'Width': 4,
  'Merge angle': 'big'
}
```
