Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1998 Mercury Mountaineer, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural roadway and was negotiating a slight curve to the left. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Ford F150, 4-door extended cab pickup truck was traveling west in the westbound lane of the same road but was negoatiating a slight curve to the right. It was daylight, the sky was cloudy, and the bituminous road was dry. The driver of V2, for an unknown reason, drifted to the left, crossed the centerline, and entered the eastbound lane of travel. The driver of V1 attempted to avoid V2 by steering right but the front of V2 struck the front of V1 in a narrow, offset-frontal configuration. After the impact, V1 veered off the right side of the road and came to rest facing south. V2 was redirected back into the westbound lane, but then traveled back across the eastbound lane, departed the left side of the road, and came to rest off the south side of the road facing southwest. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 34-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel airbag deployed. The 2-year-old right-rear male passenger was seated in a forward-facing child seat that was secured to the vehicle using the available three-point seat belt. Both occupants of V1 were transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center.
