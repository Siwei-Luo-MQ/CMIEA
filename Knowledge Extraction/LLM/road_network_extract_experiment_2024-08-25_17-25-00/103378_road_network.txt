Based on the given sketch and summary, here are the answers extracted:

1. **Ways**: Both V1 (traveling south) and V2 (traveling north) are on a two-lane, two-way rural road. Thus, the maximum number of ways at the intersection is 2.

2. **Lanes**: Each road has 2 lanes as well, so the maximum number of lanes at the intersection is also 2.

3. **Longest distance**: The sketch suggests the horizontal road where V1 is traveling represents vehicle lengths. Estimating from the sketch, if V1 spans approximately 7 vehicle lengths:  
   - Length (horizontal) = 5 meters ¡Á 7 = 35 meters.  
   The distance for the perpendicular road (where V2 is moving) is also around 7 vehicle lengths, hence similarly:  
   - Length (vertical) = 5 meters ¡Á 7 = 35 meters.  
   Thus, the longest distance from one end of the intersection to the other, being equal in this case, is 35 meters.

4. **Width of a single lane**: For a typical two-lane road, the average width of each lane is generally around 3.5 meters.

Combining these findings, the final output is as follows:

{'No_ways': 2, 'No_lanes': 2, 'Length': 35, 'Width': 3.5}
