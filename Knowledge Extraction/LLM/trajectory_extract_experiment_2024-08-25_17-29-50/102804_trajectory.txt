To process the provided sketch and summary, here's the analysis based on the defined steps:

### 1. **Determine Road Type**:
The road type is **Straight**.

### 2. **Mapping**:
- Confirm the road is horizontally aligned (as it appears to be in the sketch).
- Map the bottom-left corner of the straight road to (0, 0).
- Establish the X-axis as the horizontal direction (to the right) and the Y-axis as the vertical direction (upward).

### 3. **Extract Starting and Collision Points**:
From the sketch:
- **V1** is traveling east in the eastbound lane, while **V2** is blocking the lane at an angle.
- The collision occurs with V1 impacting the right side of V2, indicating a T-type collision configuration.

### Proposed Points:
- For **V1**:
  - Starting point (based on position in the lane): (5, 2) (assuming it is near the left edge of the lane)
  - Collision point (where V1 strikes V2): (15, 2) (a point near V2, blocking the lane)

- For **V2**:
  - Starting point (as it is stopped): (15, 4) (positioned in the lane at an angle)
  - Collision point matches V1â€™s collision point: (15, 2)

### 4. **Predict Trajectories**:
Using estimations, we can predict the intermediate points for both vehicles:
- **V1 Trajectory**: 
  - Start: (5, 2)
  - Intermediate: (8, 2.5), (11, 2.0), (13, 2.0)
  - End: (15, 2)

- **V2 Trajectory**: 
  - Start: (15, 4)
  - Intermediate: (15, 3), (15, 2.5), (15, 2)
  - End: (15, 2)

### 5. **Validation**:
According to the crash summary, V1 strikes V2 on the right side in a T-type configuration which is consistent with the predicted trajectories.

### Output Summary:
```json
{
    'V1_traj': [(5, 2), (8, 2.5), (11, 2.0), (13, 2.0), (15, 2)],
    'V2_traj': [(15, 4), (15, 3), (15, 2.5), (15, 2)],
    'Validation': 'Pass'
}
```

This output follows the analysis process and confirms that the predicted trajectories align with the incident description in the crash summary.
