Based on the provided sketch and summary, here is my output:

1. **Number of ways at most for roads bordering the intersection**: Both V1 and V2 are on two-lane roads, resulting in a maximum of 2 ways.
2. **Number of lanes at most for roads bordering the intersection**: Both roads are described as having 2 lanes, resulting in a maximum of 2 lanes.
3. **Longest distance from one end of the intersection to the other**: Based on estimates from the sketch, the longest distance appears to be 40 meters (calculated from the horizontal roadway representation).
4. **Width of a single lane**: Given common standards and without specific lane markings in the sketch, the default width of a lane is generally considered to be 4 meters.

Putting this information together, the final output is:

{'No_ways': 2, 'No_lanes': 2, 'Length': 40, 'Width': 4}
