Prompt - 108812:

I need you to work as an assistant.

I have a sketch and a summary of a car crash. Crash sketches are in graph modality while crash summaries are text data. 
In the sketches, road networks, traffic participants, trajectories, and additional crash background information are visualized. 
The crash summary is the text description of the crash, it contains road networks, traffic participants, trajectories, and environmental information. 
It is known that this car crash happened on a curve road.

You are required to extract the configuration details of this road network from the sketch and summary. To be more specific, you need to answer the following questions:
1. How many ways are there in the road? (your answer here should be an integer)
2. How many lanes in total in the road? (your answer here should be an integer)
3. What's the length of the road? (The unit is meter, you don’t need to include ‘meter’ in your answer)
4. What's the width of a single lane? (The unit is meter, you don’t need to include ‘meter’ in your answer)
5. What's the curvature of the road? (your answer should be 'small' or 'big')

To assist your calculation, here's some common knowledge you can use:
length of a car: 5 meters
width of a car: 2 meters
length of a truck: 20 meters
width of a truck: 2.5 meters
I have attached a picture to explain the size of curvature. From the picture you can see two curves, one with a small curvature, which we named C1, and the other with a large curvature, which we named C2. If you think the curvature of the road in the sketch is more similar to C1, then the answer to Question 5 is small, but if you think the curvature of the road in the sketch is more similar to C2, then the answer to Question 5 is big.

I will show you an example to help you better understand this task.

Prompt:

Crash sketch: (see attached Sketch.jpg)

Crash summary: (see attached Summary.txt)

Analysis process:

Step 1 - Extract the number of ways and lanes from crash summary
From the summary, we can know that the following sentences described the number of ways and lanes:

'Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1998 Mercury Mountaineer, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural roadway and was negotiating a slight curve to the left. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Ford F150, 4-door extended cab pickup truck was traveling west in the westbound lane of the same road but was negoatiating a slight curve to the right.'

From this sentence, we can know that these cars drive on the same road and the word - 'two-way' is used for describing the number of ways and the word - 'two-lane' is used for describing the number of lanes.
Therefor, the answer for the first question (number of ways) is 2 and the answer for the second question (number of lanes) is 2.

Step 2 - Approximate the length of the road and the width of the lane from the sketch
We define the straight-line distance between the two ends of a curve as the road length. From the sketch we can know the two ends of the curve road are located on both sides of the sketch, so we need to calculate the distance from the leftmost end to the rightmost end in the sketch.
The red rectangular block marked with V1 in the image is a car. From the sketch we can estimate that the straight-line distance between the two ends of this curve is approximately equal to 10 car body lengths.
Therefor we can calculate the length of the road in this way:
length_road = 5 x 10 = 50 meters

From the sketch, we can see that the red car is driving in the middle of a lane, and both sides of the car are about half the width of the car's body away from the edge of the lane.
Therefor we can calculate the width of the lane in this way:
width_road = 2 + 2/2 + 2/2 = 4 meters

Step 3 - Approximate the curvature
Comparing the curvature of the curved road in the sketch with C1 and C2, the curvature of the road in the sketch is obviously smaller than that of C1, so curvature = small

Finally, you need to format the output:

No_ways: 2
No_lanes:2
length_road: 50
width_road: 4
Curvature: small
