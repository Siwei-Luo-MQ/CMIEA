Based on the provided sketch, summary, and road network information, here’s the step-by-step process for the trajectory extraction, prediction, and validation:

### Step 1: Road Characteristics
- **Road Type**: Straight
- **Alignment**: The provided sketch indicates that the road is already horizontal, so no rotation is necessary.
- **Mapping**: The bottom-left corner of the roadway is set to (0, 0). We establish:
  - X-axis: horizontal (positive to the right)
  - Y-axis: vertical (positive upwards)

### Step 2: Extract Starting Points and Collision Points
From the sketch and the summary:
- **Vehicle 1 (V1)**: 
  - Starting Point: In the right northbound lane, estimated coordinates might be (6, 2)
  - Collision Point: In the left lane where the collision occurs, estimated coordinates might be (25, 6)
  
- **Vehicle 2 (V2)**:
  - Starting Point: In the left northbound lane, behind V1, estimated coordinates might be (10, 6)
  - Collision Point: Same as V1, (25, 6)

### Step 3: Predicted Trajectories
Using the starting and collision points, let's predict the trajectories with intermediate points:
- **V1 Trajectory**: 
  - From (6, 2) to (25, 6)
  - Intermediate points could be: [(10, 3), (15, 4), (20, 5)]
  
- **V2 Trajectory**: 
  - From (10, 6) to (25, 6)
  - Intermediate points could be: [(15, 6), (20, 6), (25, 6)]

### Step 4: Validate Predicted Trajectories
Based on the summary, V1 veered into V2's lane, and the collision happened in the left lane where both vehicles ended up:
- The trajectory predictions align with the vehicles’ described movements.

### Final Output Summary
```json
{
    'V1_traj': [(6, 2), (10, 3), (15, 4), (20, 5), (25, 6)],
    'V2_traj': [(10, 6), (15, 6), (20, 6), (25, 6)],
    'Validation': 'Pass'
}
```

This output includes the predicted trajectories for both vehicles and confirms that the trajectory behavior matches the description in the crash summary.
