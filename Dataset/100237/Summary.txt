Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1997 Pontiac Grand Am, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way residential roadway and was approaching a 4-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Toyota Sequoia, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling north in the northbound lane of the intersecting two-lane, two-way road and was approaching the same intersection as V1. It was daylight, the sky was cloudy, and the bituminous road was dry. V1 and V2 entered the intersection at the same time and the front of V2 struck the right side of V1 in a T-type configuration. Both vehicles were driveable and both were driven away from the scene. The 28-year-old female driver of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt but the steering wheel airbag did not deploy. The 27-year-old female right-front passenger of V1 was not using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted airbag did not deploy. The 7-year-old female left-rear passenger (case occupant) was improperly using the three-point seat belt by placing the shoulder belt under her arm. The 4-year-old male right-rear passenger was using the available three-point seat belt. The case occupant was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center. The other three occupants of V1 did not seek medical attention.
