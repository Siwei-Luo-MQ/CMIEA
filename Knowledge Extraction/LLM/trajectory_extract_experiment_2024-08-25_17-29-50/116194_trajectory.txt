Let's analyze the provided crash sketch and summary based on the specified points for a straight road.

### Analysis Process:

1. **Road Type**: The road type is **Straight**.
  
2. **Mapping**:
   - Ensure the road is horizontally aligned (it already appears to be).
   - Map the bottom-left corner of the road in the sketch to (0, 0).
   - Establish the X-axis along the horizontal direction (right as positive) and the Y-axis along the vertical direction (upward as positive).

3. **Extract Start and Collision Points**:
   - Vehicle V1 (Jeep Cherokee) is traveling west in the right westbound lane.
   - Vehicle V2 (Pontiac Grand Prix) is traveling east in the eastbound lane.
   - Based on the sketch, we place the starting points approximately:
     - **V1**: Starting point [(15, 5)] (right westbound lane).
     - **V2**: Starting point [(40, 5)] (eastbound lane).
   - Collision occurs when V1 drifts into V2â€™s lane.

4. **Collision Point**: We approximate the collision point as [(25, 5)] where the paths intersect.

5. **Predict Trajectories**:
   - For **V1**: Start at (15, 5), with intermediate points calculated towards (25, 5):
     - Predicted trajectory: \([(15, 5), (18, 5), (21, 5), (23, 5), (25, 5)]\)
   - For **V2**: Start at (40, 5), with a trajectory calculated towards (25, 5):
     - Predicted trajectory: \([(40, 5), (35, 5), (30, 5), (27, 5), (25, 5)]\)

6. **Validation**: The trajectories align with the described interaction where V1 crossed over to V2's lane resulting in a frontal strike.

### Output Summary
```json
{
    'V1_traj': [(15, 5), (18, 5), (21, 5), (23, 5), (25, 5)],
    'V2_traj': [(40, 5), (35, 5), (30, 5), (27, 5), (25, 5)],
    'Validation': 'Pass'
}
``` 

This output summarizes the expected trajectories and confirms their validity according to the crash summary description provided.
