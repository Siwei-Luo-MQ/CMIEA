Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1998 Jeep Cherokee Sport, 2-door utility vehicle was traveling on a one-way entrance ramp and was attempting to enter the right westbound lane of a six-lane, divided, limited-access freeway (three lanes westbound, protected median, three lanes eastbound). Vehicle two (V2), a 2000 Peterbilt tractor pulling one trailer was traveling west in the right westbound lane and was approaching the merge area where V1 was traveling. It was daylight, raining, and the bituminous raod was wet. The driver of V1 lost control on the wet road and began to enter the right westbound lane while rotating in a counterclockwise manner. The driver of V2 could not avoid V1 and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in a T-type configuration. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage while V2 was driven away. The 28-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt but no airbags deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center.
