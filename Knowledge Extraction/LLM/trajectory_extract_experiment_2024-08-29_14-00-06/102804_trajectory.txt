To analyze the provided crash sketch and summary data, we'll follow the steps outlined previously, specifically focusing on the straight road type. Let's proceed:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Road Type**: The road type is identified as **Straight**.

2. **Mapping**:
   - Ensure the straight road is horizontally aligned (it is).
   - Map the bottom-left corner of the straight road to (0, 0).
   - Establish the X-axis along the horizontal direction (right as positive) and the Y-axis along the vertical direction (upward as positive).

3. **Extracting Starting Points and Collision Points**:
   - **Vehicle V1**: Starting position at the left side of the sketch in the eastbound lane. 
   - **Vehicle V2**: Positioned at an angle blocking the eastbound lane.
   - The collision occurs when V1 strikes the right side of V2, creating a T-type collision.

4. **Defining Coordinates**:
   - For V1: 
     - Starting point ~ (5, 2) [to the east-left before collision]
     - Collision point at (30, 2) [where V1 impacts V2].
   - For V2: 
     - Positioning at (20, 2) [blocking the lane at an angle].
     - Collision point also at (30, 2).

5. **Predict Trajectories**:
   - **V1 Trajectory**: 
     - Starting: (5, 2)
     - Intermediate points: (10, 2), (15, 2), (25, 2)
     - End: (30, 2)
   - **V2 Trajectory**: Not needed for prediction since V2 is stationary.

### Validation Based on Summary:
The analysis aligns with the summary indicating that V1 failed to see V2 and collided with its right side, confirming the trajectory predictions.

### Output Summary
```json
{
    'V1_traj': [(5, 2), (10, 2), (15, 2), (25, 2), (30, 2)],
    'V2_traj': [(20, 2)],  // stationary position
    'Validation': 'Pass'
}
```

This structured output captures the trajectories of the involved vehicles and confirms that the predictions are consistent with the crash dynamics described in the summary.
