Prompt 1:

I need you to work as an assistant on this task.

I have a dataset about car crashes, each crash contains a crash summary. The crash summary is the text description of the crash, it contains road networks, traffic participants, trajectories, and environmental information.

Now, I need you to extract the environmental information from the crash summary. To be specific, I need you to extract the weather and time from the crash summary. I have three rules for your answer:

1. Your answers for weather must be selected from these eight values: Sunny; Cloudy; Overcast; Rainy; Snowy; Foggy; Windy; Clear

2. Your answers for time must be selected from these two values: daytime; nighttime. 

3. If you can't find any description of the weather or the time, you need to output 'not mentioned'.

I will first show you one example to help you better understand this task.

Prompt 2:

Crash summary: (see attached Summary.txt)

Analysis process:

Step 1 - Locate the description of weather and time from the summary.

'It was daylight, snowing, and the bituminous road was icy.'

Step 2 - Extract the weather and time from the description

From the description we get in step 1, we can know that the word - 'snowing' is used for describing weather, and we can find the weather corresponding to 'snowing' from the weather answer list: Snowy

From the description we get in step 1, we can know that the word - 'daylight' is used for describing time, and we can find the time corresponding to 'daylight' from the time answer list: daytime

Answer:

Weather: Snowy

Time: Daytime
