To analyze the sketch and summary for this car crash, we will follow the same steps as before to extract the required information.

### Step 1 - Extract the number of ways and lanes from the crash summary

From the summary, we discern that:

- Vehicle one (V1) is on a two-lane, two-way rural road.
- Vehicle two (V2) is also on a two-lane, two-way rural road.

Thus,
- For V1: number_of_ways_v1 = 2, number_of_lanes_v1 = 2
- For V2: number_of_ways_v2 = 2, number_of_lanes_v2 = 2

Therefore, for question 1 (No_ways), the largest value is 2, and for question 2 (No_lanes), the largest value is also 2.

### Step 2 - Approximate the longest distance from one end of the intersection to the other

In the sketch, we analyze the roads:

1. **Horizontal direction** (where V1 is located):
   - The estimated length of the road here is represented by the car lengths. Assuming length is roughly 7 car lengths.
   - Length = 5 m * 7 = 35 m

2. **Vertical direction** (where V2 is located):
   - Similarly, estimating the length as roughly 6 car lengths.
   - Length = 5 m * 6 = 30 m

Taking the longest length for question 3, we have 35 m.

### Step 3 - Approximate the width of the lane

Since this is a two-lane, two-way road, and assuming standard lane width:

- The default lane width is approximately 4 meters for question 4.

### Final output

Putting all the extracted information together, we format the output as follows:

```json
{'No_ways': 2, 'No_lanes': 2, 'Length': 35, 'Width': 4}
```
