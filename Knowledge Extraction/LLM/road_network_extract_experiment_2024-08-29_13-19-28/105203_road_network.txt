Based on the provided crash sketch and summary, here are the extracted configuration details of the road network:

1. The main road has vehicles V1 and V2 traveling west, indicating that it is a two-lane, two-way road.
   - No_ways_main_road: 2
   - No_lanes_main_road: 2

2. The branch road, in this case, is defined as the opposing eastbound lane where vehicle V3 is traveling.
   - No_ways_branch_road: 2
   - No_lanes_branch_road: 2

3. To approximate the lengths and width from the sketch:
   - For the main road length (westbound), V2 is ahead of V1 in their lane. The length appears to be around 6 car lengths. Therefore, the length of the main road would be about:
     length_main_road = 5 * 6 = 30 meters.
   
   - For the branch road length (eastbound), V3 appears to take up about 3 car lengths' worth of space in the lane, indicating the length would be:
     length_branch_road = 5 * 3 = 15 meters.
   
   - The width of a lane can be estimated by observing that a car (width = 2 meters) has some space on either side. The total lane width can be approximated as:
     Width = 2 + (2/2) + (2/2) = 4 meters.

Now formatting the output:

{
  'No_ways_main_road': 2,
  'No_lanes_main_road': 2,
  'No_ways_branch_road': 2,
  'No_lanes_branch_road': 2,
  'Length_main': 30,
  'Length_branch': 15,
  'Width': 4
}
