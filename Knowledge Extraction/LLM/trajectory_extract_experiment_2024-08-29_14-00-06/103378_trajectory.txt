To analyze the provided case, we will follow the specified steps:

### 1. Determine the Road Type
- **Road Type**: Intersection

### 2. Mapping
For an intersection:
- Map the center of the intersection to (0, 0).
- Establish the X-axis horizontally (right as positive) and the Y-axis vertically (upward as positive).

### 3. Extracting Starting and Collision Points
- **Vehicle V1 (Ford Aspire)**: Driving south in the southbound lane.
- **Vehicle V2 (Chevrolet C10)**: Driving north in the northbound lane.

Given that V1 drifted into V2's lane, we will place:
- **V1 Starting Point**: Approx. (-10, -2) (southern approach before drifting)
- **Collision Point**: Approx. (0, 0) (at the center of the intersection where they collided)
- **V2 Starting Point**: Approx. (10, 2) (northern approach in its lane)

### 4. Predicted Trajectories
We'll estimate three intermediate points between the starting and collision points for each vehicle.

- **V1 Trajectory**: 
  - Start at (-10, -2), with points as follows:
    - (-7, -1)
    - (-5, 0)
    - (-2, 0)
    - End at (0, 0)

- **V2 Trajectory**: 
  - Start at (10, 2), with points as follows:
    - (8, 1)
    - (5, 0)
    - (2, 1)
    - End at (0, 0)

### 5. Validation
The summary states that V1 crossed into V2â€™s lane due to the driver falling asleep. Both vehicles collided at the center of the intersection, and the predicted trajectories align with this behavior.

### Output Summary
```json
{
    'V1_traj': [(-10, -2), (-7, -1), (-5, 0), (-2, 0), (0, 0)],
    'V2_traj': [(10, 2), (8, 1), (5, 0), (2, 1), (0, 0)],
    'Validation': 'Pass'
}
```

This structure reflects the trajectories for both vehicles, with congruence to the circumstances around the collision outlined in the summary.
