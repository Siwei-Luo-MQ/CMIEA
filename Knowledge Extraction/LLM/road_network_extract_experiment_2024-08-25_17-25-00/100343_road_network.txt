Based on the provided information:

1. **Number of ways**: The summary mentions a "divided freeway" with "two lanes northbound" and "two lanes southbound," indicating it is a **two-way road**. Therefore, the number of ways is **2**.

2. **Number of lanes**: The summary indicates a "four-lane" roadway (two northbound and two southbound). Hence, the total number of lanes is **4**.

3. **Length of the road**: From the sketch, we can estimate the length of the road based on the visible distance. Assuming the road length is approximately **10 car lengths**, we calculate it as:
   - 5 meters (length of a car) x 10 = **50** meters.

4. **Width of a single lane**: The width can be estimated based on the width of the cars and the spacing. Assuming a reasonable single lane width of **3.5 meters** (standard for highways), the calculation would follow the assumption commonly used for lane width.

Putting this all together:

{'No_ways': 2, 'No_lanes': 4, 'Length': 50, 'Width': 3.5}
