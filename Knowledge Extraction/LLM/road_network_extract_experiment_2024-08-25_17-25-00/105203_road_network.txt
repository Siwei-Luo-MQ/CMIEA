Based on the provided crash sketch and summary, here are the extracted configuration details:

1. **From the summary, V1 is traveling west in a two-lane, two-way roadway.** This means:
   - No_ways_main_road = 2 (both directions)
   - No_lanes_main_road = 2 (two lanes total)

2. **Branch Road Information:**
   - Since there is no mention of a distinct branch road in the summary and it's a two-lane road where all vehicles are on the same road, we can assume the following:
   - No_ways_branch_road = 2 (same for both directions as it¡¯s a two-lane)
   - No_lanes_branch_road = 2 (total lanes)

3. **Estimating Lengths and Width:**
   - For the main road:
     - Observing from the sketch, the main road appears to be approximately 6 car lengths (using the car length of 5 meters).
     - Length_main_road = 5 * 6 = 30 meters.

   - For the branch road:
     - The sketch suggests no additional branch roads are present; hence we can consider this as a shared road.
     - Length_branch_road = 0 (not applicable).

   - Width of a single lane:
     - Based on similar calculations as in the previous example, I'll estimate the lane width. Typical lane widths are about 3 meters.
     - Width = 3 meters.

Combining these observations, the final output structure would be:

```json
{'No_ways_main_road': 2, 'No_lanes_main_road': 2, 'No_ways_branch_road': 2, 'No_lanes_branch_road': 2, 'Length_main': 30, 'Length_branch': 0, 'Width': 3}
```
