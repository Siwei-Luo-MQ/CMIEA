Prompt - 100237:

I need you to work as an assistant.

I have a sketch and a summary of a car crash. Crash sketches are in graph modality while crash summaries are text data. 
In the sketches, road networks, traffic participants, trajectories, and additional crash background information are visualized. 
The crash summary is the text description of the crash, it contains road networks, traffic participants, trajectories, and environmental information. 
It is known that this car crash happened on an Intersection road.

You are required to extract the configuration details of this road network from the sketch and summary. To be more specific, you need to answer the following questions:
1. How many ways are there at most for roads bordering the intersection? (your answer here should be an integer)
2. How many lanes are there at most for roads bordering the intersection? (your answer here should be an integer)
3. What is the longest distance from one end of the intersection to the other? (The unit is meter, you don’t need to include ‘meter’ in your answer)
4. What's the width of a single lane? (The unit is meter, you don’t need to include ‘meter’ in your answer)

To assist your calculation, here's some common knowledge you can use:
length of a car: 5 meters
width of a car: 2 meters
length of a truck: 20 meters
width of a truck: 2.5 meters

I will show you an example to help you better understand this task.

Prompt:

Crash sketch: (see attached Sketch.jpg)

Crash summary: (see attached Summary.txt)

Analysis process:

Step 1 - Extract the number of ways and lanes from crash summary

From the summary, we can know that the following sentences described the number of ways and lanes:

'Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1997 Pontiac Grand Am, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way residential roadway and was approaching a 4-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Toyota Sequoia, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling north in the northbound lane of the intersecting two-lane, two-way road and was approaching the same intersection as V1.'

From the above sentences, we can know that:
V1 is driving on a two-lane, two-way residential roadway. Therefore, for the road where V1 is located, number_of_ways_v1 = 2, number_of_lanes_v1 = 2
V2 is driving on a two-lane, two-way road. Therefore, for the road where V2 is located, number_of_ways_v2 = 2, number_of_lanes_v2 = 2
Furthermore, for question 1, we need to select the largest value between number_of_ways_v1 and number_of_ways_v2, so the value of questions 1 is 2.
For question 2, we need to select the largest value between number_of_lanes_v2 and number_of_lanes_v2, so the value of questions 2 is 2.


Step 2 - Approximate the longest distance from one end of the intersection to the other

From the sketch, we know that the center of the intersection is roughly located at the center of the sketch. There are two roads in the sketch, one horizontal and one longitudinal, so we need to calculate the length of the road in the horizontal direction and the length of the road in the longitudinal direction, and compare the two, and take the longest one as the answer to question 3.

First calculate the length of the road in the horizontal direction:
The red square marked with V1 in the horizontal direction represents a car. It is known that the length of the car is about 5 meters. From the figure, it can be estimated that the length of the road in the horizontal direction is about 8 car body lengths, so
length_horizontal_road = 5 x 8 = 40 meters

Next, calculate the length of the road in the longitudinal direction:
The blue square marked with V2 in the longitudinal direction represents a car. It is known that the length of the car is about 5 meters. From the figure, it can be estimated that the length of the road in the longitudinal direction is about 7 car body lengths, so
length_longitudinal_road = 5 x 7 = 35 meters

For question 3, we need to select the largest value between length_horizontal_road and length_longitudinal_road, so the value of questions 3 is 40.

Step 3 - Approximate the width of the lane from the sketch

From the analysis results of Step 1, we know that this is a two-lane, two-way road, but the lane dividing line is not drawn in the sketch, so we cannot estimate the lane width based on the car width and lane shape. Therefore, for question 4, we can only give the default width of the lane, which is 4 meters.

Finally, you need to format the output:

No_ways: 2
No_lanes:2
Length: 40
Width: 4
