Prompt - 100237:

I need you to work as an assistant.

I have a sketch and a summary of a car crash. Crash sketches are in graph modality while crash summaries are text data. 
In the sketches, road networks, traffic participants, trajectories, and additional crash background information are visualized. 
The crash summary is the text description of the crash, it contains road networks, traffic participants, trajectories, and environmental information. 
It is known that this car crash happened on an Intersection road.

You are required to extract the configuration details of this road network from the sketch and summary. To be more specific, you need to answer the following questions:
1. How many ways are there at most for roads bordering the intersection? (your answer here should be an integer)
2. How many lanes are there at most for roads bordering the intersection? (your answer here should be an integer)
3. What is the longest distance from one end of the intersection to the other? (The unit is meter, you don’t need to include ‘meter’ in your answer)
4. What's the width of a single lane? (The unit is meter, you don’t need to include ‘meter’ in your answer)

To assist your calculation, here's some common knowledge you can use:
length of a car: 5 meters
width of a car: 2 meters
length of a truck: 20 meters
width of a truck: 2.5 meters

I will show you an example to help you better understand this task.

Prompt:

Crash sketch: (see attached Sketch.jpg)

Crash summary: (see attached Summary.txt)

Analysis process:

Step 1 - Extract the number of ways and lanes from crash summary
From the summary, we can know that the following sentences described the number of ways and lanes:
'Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1999 Ford Taurus, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way roadway.'
From this sentence, we can know that the word - 'two-way' is used for describing the number of ways and the word - 'two-lane' is used for describing the number of lanes.
Therefor, the answer for the first question (number of ways) is 2 and the answer for the second question (number of lanes) is 2.

Step 2 - Approximate the length of the road and the width of the lane from the sketch
From the sketch we can know the two ends of the straight road are located on both sides of the sketch, so we need to calculate the distance from the leftmost end to the rightmost end in the sketch.
The red rectangular block marked with V1 in the image is a car. From the sketch we can estimate that the length of the straight road is approximately equal to 11 car body lengths.
Therefor we can calculate the length of the road in this way:
5 x 11 = 55 meters

From the sketch, we can see that the red car is driving in the middle of a lane, and both sides of the car are about half the width of the car's body away from the edge of the lane.
Therefor we can calculate the width of the lane in this way:
2 + 2/2 + 2/2 = 4 meters

Finally, you need to format the output:

No_ways: 2
No_lanes:2
Length: 55
Width: 4
