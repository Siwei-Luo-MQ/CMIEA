Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1996 Ford Aspire, 3-door hatchback was traveling south in the southbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road. Vehicle two (V2), a 1980 Chevrolet C10, pickup truck was traveling north in the northbound lane of the same road. It was dark, the sky was clear, and the bituminous road was dry. The driver of V1 reportedly fell asleep while driving and V1 drifted across the centerline and into the northbound lane. The driver of V2 noticed that V1 had entered his travel lane and steered to the right but could not avoid striking V1. The front of V1 struck the front of V2 partially in the northbound lane and partially on the east shoulder. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 21-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel airbag deployed. She was 38-weeks pregnant at the time of the crash. She was transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center.
