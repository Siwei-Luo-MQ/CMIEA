Based on the provided sketch and summary, here are the extracted details:

1. **Number of ways on the main road (No_ways_main_road)**: 2
2. **Number of lanes on the main road (No_lanes_main_road)**: 6
3. **Number of lanes on the branch road (No_lanes_branch_road)**: 2
4. **Length of the main road (Length_main)**: 60 (approximate length based on the sketch)
5. **Width of a single lane (Width)**: 4 (calculated based on the car's width)
6. **Merge angle (Merge angle)**: 'small' (angle is less than 45 degrees)

Putting this together, the output is:

```
{'No_ways_main_road': 2, 'No_lanes_main_road': 6, 'No_lanes_branch_road': 2, 'Length_main': 60, 'Width': 4, 'Merge angle': 'small'}
```
