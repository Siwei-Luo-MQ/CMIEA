Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2000 Pontiac Sunfire, 2-door coupe was traveling east in the right eastbound lane of a six-lane divided, limited access freeway (three eastbound travel lanes, protected median, three westbound lanes). It was daylight and raining, and the bituminous roadway was wet. Vehicle two (V2), a 1999 Dodge Ram conversion van, was traveling east in the eastbound lane of an entrance ramp and was attempting to enter the same freeway that V1 was traveling on. As V1 approached an area of mergance (end of an entrance ramp), the driver lost control due to standing water on the roadway. V1 began to rotate in a counterclockwise manner while it departed the right side of the road and entered onto the acceleration lane of the on-ramp. The driver of V2 attempted to stop but could not avoid striking the left-side of V1 with the front of V2. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage and V2 was driven from the scene. The 26-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt but no airbags deployed. She was transported to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center. The driver of V2 was not injured and did not seek treatment.
