Let's tackle the case step by step, following the provided instructions and mapping guidelines for an intersection.

### Analysis Steps

1. **Road Type**: **Intersection**
2. **Mapping**:
   - We'll map the center of the intersection to (0, 0).
   - The X-axis will go horizontally (right as the positive direction).
   - The Y-axis will go vertically (upward as the positive direction).

3. **Extract Starting and Collision Points**:
   - Based on the sketch and the summary, V1 is traveling east and V2 is traveling north.
   - V1 strikes the right side of V2 in a T-type collision configuration at the intersection.

### Determining Points
- V1 (eastbound):
  - Start point (before the intersection): Let's set it at (-10, 0).
  - Collision point (at the intersection): Set it at (0, 0).

- V2 (northbound):
  - Start point (before the intersection): Set it at (0, 10).
  - Collision point (at the intersection): Also at (0, 0).

### Predicting Trajectories
We'll interpolate the trajectories with intermediate points based on the linear paths of the vehicles:
- **V1 trajectory**:
  - Starting at (-10, 0).
  - Intermediate points could be (-5, 0), (-2, 0), (-1, 0), and arriving at (0, 0).

- **V2 trajectory**:
  - Starting at (0, 10).
  - Intermediate points could be (0, 7), (0, 5), (0, 2), and arriving at (0, 0).

### Final Outputs

The predicted trajectories for both vehicles and validation would look like this:

```json
{
    'V1_traj': [(-10, 0), (-5, 0), (-2, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 0)],
    'V2_traj': [(0, 10), (0, 7), (0, 5), (0, 2), (0, 0)],
    'Validation': 'Pass'
}
```

In this output:
- **V1_traj**: Displays points of V1 moving east towards the intersection and colliding with V2.
- **V2_traj**: Displays points of V2 moving north toward the intersection before the collision.
- **Validation**: Indicates that the predicted trajectories align with the summary's description of the vehicles' behaviors during the accident.
