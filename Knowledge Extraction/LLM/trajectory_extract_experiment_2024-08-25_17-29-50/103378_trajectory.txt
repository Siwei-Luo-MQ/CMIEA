Let's process the provided data according to the specified analysis steps for the intersection road type.

### Analysis Steps

1. **Road Type**: **Intersection**
2. **Mapping**:
   - Map the center of the intersection to (0, 0).
   - Establish the X-axis along the horizontal direction (right as positive) and the Y-axis along the vertical direction (upward as positive).

3. **Extract Starting and Collision Points**:
   - Vehicle V1 is traveling south in the southbound lane.
   - Vehicle V2 is traveling north in the northbound lane.
   - The collision occurs when V1 drifts into V2's lane.

4. **Determine Starting and Collision Points**:
   - For V1 (Ford Aspire): Start point is approximately (2, -5) and collision point is at (0, 0).
   - For V2 (Chevrolet C10): Start point is approximately (-5, 5) and also ends at (0, 0).

5. **Predict Trajectories**: Creating intermediate points for each vehicle:
   - **V1 trajectory**: Start at (2, -5), with intermediate points (1, -4), (0, -3), (-1, -2), and end at (0, 0).
   - **V2 trajectory**: Start at (-5, 5), with intermediate points (-3, 4), (-1, 3), (0, 1), and end at (0, 0).

6. **Validation**: According to the summary, V1 drifting into V2â€™s lane aligns with the predicted trajectories.

### Output Summary
```json
{
    'V1_traj': [(2, -5), (1, -4), (0, -3), (-1, -2), (0, 0)],
    'V2_traj': [(-5, 5), (-3, 4), (-1, 3), (0, 1), (0, 0)],
    'Validation': 'Pass'
}
```

This summary incorporates the trajectory information and confirms that the predicted trajectories correspond with the behaviors described in the crash summary.
