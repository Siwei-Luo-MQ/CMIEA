Letâ€™s execute the analysis using the provided crash sketch, summary, and road network information, following the specified mapping approach for a T-intersection:

### Analysis Steps

1. **Road Type**: **T-intersection**
   
2. **Mapping**: 
   - Ensure the main road is horizontal and the side road is vertical, with the side road below the main road.
   - Center point of the intersection will be mapped to (0, 0).
   - Establish the X-axis horizontally (right as positive) and the Y-axis vertically (upward as positive).

3. **Extract Starting Points and Collision Points**:
   - **Vehicle V1** starts in the eastbound left-turn lane and is turning left into the intersection.
   - **Vehicle V2** is traveling south in the through lane and collides with V1 on the left side.
   - Both vehicles approach the intersection from different roads and collide at (0, 0).

4. **Determine Starting and Collision Points**:
   - **V1** (from left turning lane towards the intersection): Starting point estimated at (-10, 1) leading to the collision point at (0, 0).
   - **V2** (traveling south in the through lane): Starting point estimated at (5, -5) and colliding at (0, 0).

5. **Predict Trajectories**:
   - **V1 trajectory**: Start at (-10, 1), with intermediate points (-5, 0.5), (-2, 0), and end at (0, 0).
   - **V2 trajectory**: Start at (5, -5), with intermediate points (3, -3), (1, -2), and end at (0, 0).

6. **Validation**: Based on the summary, the movements align with the described behaviors during the collision.

### Output Summary
```json
{
    'V1_traj': [(-10, 1), (-5, 0.5), (-2, 0), (0, 0)],
    'V2_traj': [(5, -5), (3, -3), (1, -2), (0, 0)],
    'Validation': 'Pass'
}
```

This structured output captures the trajectory details for both vehicles and confirms that the predictions are consistent with the description provided in the crash summary.
